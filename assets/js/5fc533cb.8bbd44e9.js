Some common operations that you will need to know is how to create a NumPy array, how to get its shape and access its elements. Moreover, there are some functions that is useful for you when working with NumPy arrays such as mathematical functions, statistical functions and lastly matrix operations."))}d.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
